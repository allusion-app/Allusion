            <p>
              Finding such images has become relatively easy through the use of internet technology.
              Managing such images on the other hand, has remained a challenge. Clearly, it is not
              the amount of images that we can store, but a question of what we can effectively
              access, that matters. If only a handful of images were relevant to us, it would be
              easy to keep them in mind, but many artists are interested in creating their own
              curated library, and in such, it becomes increasingly difficult to remember where
              images were. Again, Allusion was created to help artists organize their visual
              library. To learn more about how Allusion works, please read on.

              Library setup refers to the process of getting your images into Allusion, so that they
              are available to be managed and viewed. Rather than manually importing images from
              your filesystem, Allusion focuses on linked folders, which we refer to as{' '}
              <b>Locations</b>. Read on to find out about how to add images to your Allusion
              library.

        title: 'Locations',
        content: (
          <>
            <p>
              In Allusion, the primary way of adding images to your library is the use of
              "Locations". A location in this context is a link to a folder on your computer. This
              means that all images in that folder as well as any subfolders will be automatically
              loaded once it is added to your list of locations.
              <br />
              The benefit of this system is that you can have full control over where your data is
              stored, while not having to tediously import images manually from various places. To
              add more images, simply place them into the linked folder, and they will automatically
              show up in Allusion.
              <br />
              However, removing images from a linked folder will not automatically remove them from
              Allusion in order to prevent you from losing the tags you assigned to them when you
              accidentially remove your images, or move them elsewhere. To confirm to Allusion the
              files were deleted intentionally, you can select those images in the "Missing images"
              view and pressing the delete button in the toolbar. Otherwise, you can simply place
              the images back to their original path so that Allusion will automatically detect them
              again.
              <br />
              You are free to rename your images, and to move them to a different folder, as long as
              they remain within the same location. Allusion will automatically detect those changes
              upon you restarting the application.
            </p>
            <p>
              To add a new location, open the outliner and hover with your mouse over the location's
              header. You will see a small plus icon to the right. Once you click the icon, go ahead
              and browse the folder that contains images. Confirm your selection and select your
              location preferences in the following popup. Once you confirm, your images will show
              up in the content area.
            </p>
            <p>
              To remove a location, open the outliner and right click on a location. A context menu
              will open with the option to remove your location. You have to confirm this action.
              Please be aware that removing a location will delete all tagging information that may
              have been attached to images of that location. The images themselves on your
              filesystem however, will of course remain.

              Another way of quickly importing images is by dragging them into your list of
              locations in the the application window. You can drag them from your file explorer,
              but also from any other sources like a web browser. When dropping those images, they

              A browser extension for Chromium-based browsers such as Google Chrome and Edge is
              available. It allows you to import images into Allusion directly from your web browser
              and immediately tag them as well. Take a look in the "Background Processes" section in
              the settings window for more information.

              You can save the tags stored in Allusion's internal database to the metadata of your
              image files. This allows you to view them in other applications, such as your file
              browser and tools like Adobe Bridge. This option is available in the "Import/Export"
              section of the settings window. Importing tags from file metadata can be performed in
              the same place.

              Although it is possible to create tags on the fly, it is recommended to set up a
              useful tags in advance to take full advantage of the organized tag structures that can
              be set up in the outliner. The outliner has a tag related section below your
              locations. In this section you are able to create, edit and organize your tags.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create a new tag, simply press the icon next to the header. You have to hover the
              mouse over the region for the icon to become visible. Similarly, you can create a tag
              category by pressing the icon next to it. A tag is used to label images while a tag
              category can be thought of as a folder for tags.
            </p>
            <p>
              To organize your tags, simply drag the list items across the outliner. You can drop an
              item onto a tag category to place it inside. In this way you can turn a list of many
              tags into a structured shape, so that it is easy for you to find the specific tags you
              were looking for.

          <>
            <p>
              There are several ways to tag an image. First, you can drag a tag from the outliner
              onto an image. This also works on a selection of multiple images. Next, you can select
              an image, press T to open the tag editor, and assign or remove tags from the list.
              This method also allows you to tag multiple images at once. Finally, you can add tags
              by adding them to the list in the inspector panel - the sidebar on the right when
              viewing images at at full size.
            </p>
            <p>
              To remove tags from one or more images, you have to access either the tag editor or
              the inspector. In both places you will be able to remove individual tags or clear the
              entire set of tags on the selected image(s).

              In Allusion there are several ways to find specific images. By default, the search bar

              To open the quick search, click on the magnifying glass icon in the toolbar, or use
              the shortcut Ctrl-F. A search bar will gain focus near the top of the window. Once you
              start typing, Allusion will make suggestions with an indication of where the item is a
              tag or a collection. Select the item from the list to add it to your search. You can

              The advanced search can be opened by pressing on the icon on the far left side of the
              quick search bar, or by the Ctrl-Shift-F shortcut. In that window you are able to
              create as many search criteria as you wish by listing them up. Each row in the
              interface represents one criteria and consists of three input fields. First select the
              type of information you want to look for. You can search for tags and file properties
              such as their name, size, type and creation date. You can then select an operator such
              as &quote;equals&quote;, &quote;greater than&quote;, &quote;includes&quote; etc.
              Finally you can enter the value of the selected property you wish to look for. Adding
              multiple criteria will again help you narrow down a search result.

            <p>
              To provide some extra control when searching with multiple queries, you can swap

              available at the bottom of the advanced search panel, and at the right in the search
