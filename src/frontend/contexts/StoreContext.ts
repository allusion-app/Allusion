 * Prop drilling is the act of passing props down many nested components, because a deeply nested
 * component requires some object, such as the RootStore, in order to update an entity in the database.
 * Contexts can be used to store objects seperate from the DOM tree, and can be easily accessed
 * from any component on the DOM tree.
