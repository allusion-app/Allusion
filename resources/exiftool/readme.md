# Exiftool

These files were downloaded from https://exiftool.org/index.html
- The `win` version was renamed from `exiftool(-k).exe` to `exiftool.exe`. This one does not need the `lib` folder.
- The `nix` version was extracted from the Perl archive (first download link), renamed from `exiftool` to `exiftool.pl`. This one requires the `lib` folder.

Current version: 12.23 (April 1, 2021)
